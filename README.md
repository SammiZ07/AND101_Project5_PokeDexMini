AND101 Project 5 - Choose Your Own API

Submitted by: Carlos Hernandez

Time spent: 12 hours spent in total

Summary

Pok√©Dex Mini is an android app that fetches Pok√©mon data from the free Pok√©API and displays the sprite image, name, type(s), and size (height & weight). It includes a Random button and a search field to look up by name or numeric ID.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: üîç‚ö°Ô∏èüì±

Application Features
<!-- (This is a comment) Please be sure to change the [ ] to [x] for any features you completed. If a feature is not checked [x], you might miss the points for that item! -->

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

x Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient

x Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved

x A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

x Add a query to the API request

The query I added is lookup by Pok√©mon name (e.g., pikachu) or numeric ID (e.g., 25) via https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{query}

x Build a UI to allow users to add that query

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

x Image loading with Glide

x ViewBinding for safer UI access

x Random button selects valid IDs (1‚Äì898)

x Basic error messaging on failed requests

x Adaptive launcher icons

x Android 12+ compliant (android:exported in Manifest)

x Gradle/Java aligned to 17

API Choice

My chosen API for this project is Pok√©API.

Notes

Here's a place for any other notes on the app, it's creation process, or what you learned this unit!

Uses CodePath AsyncHTTPClient (com.codepath.libraries:asynchttpclient:2.2.0).

Layout is ConstraintLayout and uses ViewBinding.

Height/weight converted from decimeters/hectograms to meters/kilograms.

Clears the ImageView if a sprite URL is missing to avoid stale images.
